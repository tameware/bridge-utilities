**acbl_live_to_bridgewinners**

Converts bridge hand diagrams scraped from [ACBL Live](live.acbl.org) into a series of tags suitable for use in a [BridgeWinners](BridgeWinners.com) article.

The project consists of a javascript file that performs the conversion and an HTML file that provides a basic UI, plus a second javascript file that's used only for the UI.

The acbl_live_to_bridgewinners.js script can be run from a console using node.js.

You can use the script directly here:

To run the tests:

    npx mocha test.js
